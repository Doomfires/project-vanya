# project-vanya
This project is a Discord bot that exists to provide fun entertainment to my Discord server. 

## Installation
- Requirements
  - NodeJS 10.14 or newer.
  - Discord server that you are an admin on.
-Instructions
  - Install the NodeJS packages per the website, and make sure that NPM is installed in the folder that your bot is in. There are lots of tutorials online that are all the same. 
  - Connect it to your Discord server. Discord has lots of documentation found on their website and NodeJS also has lots of documentation that is really helpful. 

## Contact Information
If the project does not work, please first try reinstalling NodeJS and making sure that the bot you create for your server has the appropriate permissions. Otherwise, please feel free to contact me at erkin.george@gmail.com

## Contributing 
Feel free to contribute to this project! All I request is that you fork the project and make pull requests with one change at a time. I reserve the right to accept or reject changes based on how I envision the bot moving forward. 

## Features
- Timer that counts down in seconds.
- Theme song that plays when the bot is brought into the voice channel. 
- A function that flips a coin when the !flip command is typed into the appropriate channel. The odds are 50/50, per a normal coin. 

It acts as a test bot for future bots that will come to operate in the server. These features are subject to change at any time.
